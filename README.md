# Welcome
Hello workshop people! Thanks for joining us today for the "AI-assisted Newsletter Dashboard" workshop.

In this repository you will find all the necessary files to follow along. This repo is organzied as the following:
- The folder structure represents our workshop outline, starting with 01_MailExport
- The directories where we code are organized in three sub-categories
  - **scratch**: necessary files but only filled with comments if you want to code along the whole journey
  - **guided**: necessary files with some code filled in for a more relaxed follow along
  - **finished**: the solution we provide for the next step
- We provide all the necessary data for the following steps in the **finished** sub-directories
