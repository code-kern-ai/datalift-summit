However, It is also helpful to include the average performance over different dataset splits or random seeds with the variance or standard deviation – I sometimes adopt this simpler approach as it is more straightforward to explain. But since this article is about confidence intervals, let’s define what they are and how we can construct them...."

For example, a reinforcement learning agent can find a shortcut to getting lots of reward without completing the task as intended by the human designer. These behaviours are common, and we have collected around 60 examples so far (aggregating existing lists and ongoing contributions from the AI community)...In this post, we review possible causes for specification gaming, share examples of where this happens in practice, and argue for further work on principled approaches to overcoming specification problems..."

In a new paper, I argue that we need to distinguish between the encodings that specify how a visualization is drawn and the ones that are readable or actually read by an observer.

Such a large model size is at least annoying for many applications, while for others it’s completely prohibitive...Probabilistic data structures are a natural fit for machine learning models, so they’re quite widely used. However, they’re definitely unintuitive, which is why we refer to this solution [using a probabilistic data structure ] as a “cheat”.

We’ll then go back and fill in more of the intuition, and then describe how we use it in practice in Thinc, spaCy and floret..."

While deep learning is an extremely powerful way to find relationships in data, its use in science has been hindered by the difficulty of understanding the learned relationships. The Information Bottleneck (IB) is an information theoretic framework for understanding a relationship between an input and an output in terms of a trade-off between the fidelity and complexity of approximations to the relationship. Here we show that a crucial modification -- distributing bottlenecks across multiple components of the input -- opens fundamentally new avenues for interpretable deep learning in science..."

Choosing one action space over another (e.g. target joint positions, or Cartesian end-effector poses) can result in surprisingly stark performance differences between various downstream tasks -- and as a result, considerable research has been devoted to finding the right action space for a given application...in this work, we instead investigate how our models can discover and learn for themselves which action space to use. Leveraging recent work on implicit behavioral cloning, which takes both observations and actions as input, we demonstrate that it is possible to present the same action in multiple different spaces to the same policy -- allowing it to learn inductive patterns from each space....."
